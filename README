Model of a thalamic network, according to the paper:

Golomb D, Ahissar E, Kleinfeld D.
Coding of stimulus frequency by latency in thalamic networks through 
the interplay of GABAB-mediated feedback and stimulus shape.
J Neurophysiol. 2005 Nov 2; [Epub ahead of print] 

The program is composed of several C programs and files:

tlp.c    : main simulation program.
tplp.c   : part of the tlp.c program. It separates the columns of tlp.col.?? 
          and calculate properties of the "PSTHs".

plp.c    : independent program. It separates the columns of tlp.col.?? .
stm.c    : used for plotting the stimuli. 
intnor.c : Integrate the activity trace  - modeling results (to compute the
           normalized firing rates).

nr.c  : routines from the library "Numerical Recipes" (only few of them
        are needed for this program).

The file tlp.n.d1 is the parameter file for tlp.c.
The file tlp.nps is the parameter file for tplp.c.
The file plp.n is the parameter file for plp.c.


Experimental results (from Sosnik et al., J. Neurophysiol., 86:339-353, 2001):

intg.res.a3 - integrated PSTH for VPm.
intg.res.a4 - integrated PSTH for POm.
delay_exp - delays.

The file ptrint.com is a Unix/Linux command procedure.

Commands (for a Unix/Linux operating system):

To compile the programs

make tlp
make plp
make stm
make intnor

to run the programs and generate figure 7A-H in the paper:

ptrint.com

You should have the graphic program xmgrace.
